<h1> Hello </h1>

<p>Welcome to my blog. My name is Ivoline but you can call me Ivy. I am a Masters student in Computer Engineering at Konya Technical University. I am particularly interested in applying my experiences toward the discovery of new methods and trends that will improve state-of-the-art AI.
My technical interest are: <p>

  <ul>
    <li>Applied Machine Learning and Deep Learning</li>
    <li>Computer Vision</li>
    <li>Natural Language Processing</li>
    <li>Privacy Preserving AI</li>
    <li>Statistics and Data Engineering</li>
  </ul>


<p> As someone who believes in the power of AI for good, I worked as I believe in using AI for good and I have worked as a Junior ML Engineer in [Omdena]( https://omdena.com/).
  I also serve as a consultant for the
  <a href="https://www.udacity.com/">Udacity</a> learning platform on a part time basis, where I utilize my specialized knowledge in the fields of
  Computer Vision, Android and Java Development to provide mentorship, project reviews and other student support services.</p>

<p>My research interests are an intersection of machine learning and deep learning for computer vision and natural language processing. Outside of this, I write articles on <a href="https://medium.com/">Medium</a> and <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com//">Towards Data Science</a>.</p>

<p> Not only is this blog a way to share my AI journey with the world, it is also going to help me organize everything I learn and
  synthesize my own ideas.  As a mentor, I have had to answer the same questions multiple times to several mentees which was fun
  but also time consuming. My blog therefore doubles as a time saver. And most importantly, I hope someone somewhere gets to learn a thing or two.</p>

 <p> When I am not building software, reading articles or mentoring, you can find me traveling, watching movies, reading, listening to music or cooking.</p>

<p><b> Now, you get to see my world, through the lens of Artificial Intelligencev.<b></p>
